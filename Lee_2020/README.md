# Spatio-temporal-modelling-tutorials
These files accompany a tutorial paper on Bayesian spatio-temporal areal unit disease risk modelling using the CARBayesST package in R.
The paper will be linked to once it is published.
The .shp part of the shapefile is very large, and has thus been zipped before being uploaded. Users will need to unzip it first when they download it.
